The [SparkFun Thing Plus - ESP32-S3](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/24408) brings a powerful and versatile IoT development platform to the Thing Plus product line. It features the ESP32 WROOM-S3 MINI wireless module from espressif<sup>&trade;</sup>. The ESP32 WROOM-S3 is built around an Xtensa<sup>&reg;</sup> 32-bit LX7 processor with massive processing power that operates at up to 240 MHz. It supports both 2.4 GHz WiFi and Bluetooth<sup>&reg;</sup> 5 (LE) with a built-in PCB antenna. This version of the ESP32-S3 has 4MB Flash memory and 2MB of dynamic/PSRAM and the board also has with a &micro;SD card slot for those who need more storage space.

The module has a large set of peripherals including UART, I<sup>2</sup>C, SPI, LCD control, SDIO host, TWAI<sup>&reg;</sup> controller (compatible
with ISO 11898-1, i.e., CAN Specification 2.), and more. The module allows for customizing which GPIO pins these peripherals operate on though some are limited to specific pins. The ESP32-S3 can run two USB ports simultaneously and can even act as a USB host host device.

The Thing Plus footprint breaks out all of the ESP32-C6's 23 GPIO pins to a pair 0.1"-spaced plated through hole (PTH) headers. The board also has a USB-C connector for primary power and programming, 2-pin JST connector for a LiPo battery (not included), a microSD card slot for expanded storage, and a Qwiic connector to integrate it into SparkFun's [Qwiic ecosystem](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic). It also includes a charging circuit and fuel gauge for charging and monitoring an attached LiPo battery.
