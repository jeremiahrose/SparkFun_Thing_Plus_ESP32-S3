We've written a few example sketches for this specific board that live in the [Github repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Thing_Plus_ESP32-S3) that we recommend taking a look at as they demonstrate some important hardware use cases. You can download it from the link above or you can get a ZIP of the library by clicking the button below:
